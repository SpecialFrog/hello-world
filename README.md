Howdy world!

Adam here, I am an advanced beginner, I know HTML and CSS rather well and am struggling to figure out what direction I should take. The dynamic or static route, wordpress or gatsby/react. I've heard many great things about static site building and I am very interested but from what I understand if I want to build websites for clients, the better route is to go with wordpress so the client(s) are able to make edits themselves, once finished of course.
